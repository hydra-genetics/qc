## :speech_balloon: Introduction

The module contains rules to run different quality control tools. Most output can be compiled to one `.html` report using multiqc.
 - Fastqc is checking the raw `.fastq` files.
 - Mosdepth, samtools stats and picard's collect metrics generates reports on the resulting `.bam` files.
 - Peddy generates sex checks
 - Rseqc reports on different RNA-specific QC measures

## :heavy_exclamation_mark: Dependencies

In order to use this module, the following dependencies are required:

[![hydra-genetics](https://img.shields.io/badge/hydragenetics-0.15.0-blue)](https://github.com/hydra-genetics/)
[![pandas](https://img.shields.io/badge/pandas-1.3.1-blue)](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
[![python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.8-blue)](https://www.python.org/)
[![snakemake](https://img.shields.io/badge/snakemake-7.13.0-blue)](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
[![singularity](https://img.shields.io/badge/singularity-3.0.0-blue)](https://sylabs.io/docs/)
[![drmaa](https://img.shields.io/badge/drmaa-0.7.9-blue)](https://pypi.org/project/drmaa/)
[![tabulate](https://img.shields.io/badge/tabulate-0.8.10-blue)](https://pypi.org/project/tabulate/)

**Note! Releases of qc <= v0.1.0 needs tabulate<0.9.0 added in requirements.txt**

## :school_satchel: Preparations

### Sample and unit data

Input data should be added to [`samples.tsv`](https://github.com/hydra-genetics/qc/blob/develop/config/samples.tsv)
and [`units.tsv`](https://github.com/hydra-genetics/qc/blob/develop/config/units.tsv).
The following information need to be added to these files:

| Column Id | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **`samples.tsv`** |
| sample | unique sample/patient id, one per row |
| tumor_content | ratio of tumor cells to total cells |
| **`units.tsv`** |
| sample | same sample/patient id as in `samples.tsv` |
| type | data type identifier (one letter), can be one of **T**umor, **N**ormal, **R**NA |
| platform | type of sequencing platform, e.g. `NovaSeq` |
| machine | specific machine id, e.g. NovaSeq instruments have `@Axxxxx` |
| flowcell | identifer of flowcell used |
| lane | flowcell lane number |
| barcode | sequence library barcode/index, connect forward and reverse indices by `+`, e.g. `ATGC+ATGC` |
| fastq1/2 | absolute path to forward and reverse reads |
| adapter | adapter sequences to be trimmed, separated by comma |

### Reference data

A reference `.fasta`-file should be specified in `config.yaml` in the section `reference` and `fasta`. Picard
requires also interval files for WGS, `wgs_intervals`, and for HS metrics, `design_intervals`. Mosdepth,
samtools, and Rseqc require a `.bed` file with specified regions to be analysed.

### MultiQC

Files to be included in the MultiQC report is specified in the config file, see example [config](https://github.com/hydra-genetics/qc/blob/develop/.tests/integration/config.yaml). The report can be split into several reports based on for example sample type or rna/dna. A report configuration file for each MultiQC report can also be specified by the `config` tag in the config file which is forwarded to MultiQC.

## :white_check_mark: Testing

The workflow repository contains a small test dataset `.tests/integration` which can be run like so:

```bash
$ cd .tests/integration
$ snakemake -s ../../Snakefile -j1 --configfile config.yaml --use-singularity
```

## :rocket: Usage

To use this module in your workflow, follow the description in the
[snakemake docs](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/snakefiles/modularization.html#modules).
Add the module to your `Snakefile` like so:

```bash
module qc:
    snakefile:
        github(
            "hydra-genetics/qc",
            path="workflow/Snakefile",
            tag="v0.1.0",
        )
    config:
        config


use rule * from qc as qc_*
```

### Compatibility

Latest:
 - alignment:v0.3.0
 - prealignment:v0.5.0

 See [COMPATIBLITY.md](../master/COMPATIBLITY.md) file for a complete list of module compatibility.

### Output files

The following output files should be targeted via another rule:

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `qc/multiqc/multiqc.html` | `.html` report from multiqc |
| `qc/multiqc/multiqc_data` | directory holding multiqc data |
